## Intro
I was excited that the Blue Yeti arrived in mail yesterday.
Because I am planning to stream programming and gaming I was looking for a proper microphone.
If you are interested in my stream you can head over to my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/marcelwalk).
So I got the Blue Yeti and on Friday the [Elgato Wave 1](https://www.elgato.com/de/wave-1) will arrive too. So I will write a short review on that too in the upcoming days!

## Built Quality & Optics
It's very heavy due to its 50s-style metal frame and the very solid metal base.
The matte black color looks really nice, there are no sharp edges around the mic it is all very smooth.
The due to the heavieness and the foam on the bottom of the base the mic isn't moving around even on my slippery deskmat.

## Price
I bought the Blue Yeti for around 135 Euros, which is prtty reasonable for the quality you get.
Considering that you get a well made full metal microphone with a great sound.

## Controls
There's a built-in gain dial, a volume knob for the live-monitoring headphone jack, a mute button to pause recording, and the pattern switch, which selects between the four operating modes. The mute button is in good reach at the front of the mic and directly below it the volume know for the live-monitoring.
The mode selection dial is on the back of the mic so, if you have to switch modes frequently this can be very tedious

## Why I will return it
Dont't get me wrong here, the Blue Yeti is a really outstanding mic both in its build quality and the recording quality
but I have issues with my empty flat where the ecsho is pretty noticale during my test streams where my headset mic performes a lot better.
Also the Elgato Wave Link software, which I already took a look at, for the previously mentioned Elgato Wave 1 is more fitting for me.
If you want to know why, wait for my Wave 1 review!
